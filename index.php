				<p>Thanks for visiting, right, we have some explaining to do.
We are in the process of changing ownership/management, . LuckyBones Tips will be back with a fresh new look and a more interactive site. We will still have input from the previous owners and maybe even their own tips section, they are a great bunch of guys and know their stuff.  BLT V2 is already in progress but isn't quite ready yet.
</p>

				
				<h3>So why have you taken the site down?</h3>
				<p>Simply put, it's easier to get everything ready this way. It means we can focus on getting the new site up and running without dealing with the old website.</p>

				<h3>What can we expect from V2 of LBT and what does V2 mean?</h3>
				<p>Well, I'm glad you asked, V2 simply means version 2 and we have tons of ideas and plan on implementing many over the coming year. Unlike V1 the new site will be much more than a blog listing all the tips and news, here is a little sneaky preview:

				<ul>
					<li>Shiny new user accounts</li>
					<li>Forums (for all those extra bits of info you need to know</li>
					<li>Ability to post your own tips (build your own following)</li>
					<li>Up the minute prices from top bookies</li>
					<li>And much much more :)</li>
				</ul>


				</p>

				<h3>Can we contact you while the site is down?</h3>
				<p>Of course! We are always happy to hear from our visitors, you can find us at <a href="mailto:info@luckybonestips.uk">info@luckybonestips.uk</a></p>
				<span class="seperator"></span>

				<p>Finally, thanks so much for waiting. We're hoping LBT V2 is something that will grow into a place where you can share and hone your betting skills.</p>
